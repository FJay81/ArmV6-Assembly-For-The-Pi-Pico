# ArmV6-Assembly-For-The-Pi-Pico
an overview and basic kickstarter for anyone wanting to learn to program their pi pico in assembly. 
Remember this is for new people or a quick refresher for the assembly

Start with infLoops to make sure you can compile everything and move on from there, how ever my recommended order would be registers then conditional loops then math then whatever i add next
